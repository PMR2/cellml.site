The Debian LSB compatible scripts included here can be copied to
``/etc/init.d``

Update $INSTANCE_HOME in each of the scripts, then do the following:

    # update-rc.d cellml.zeoserver defaults
    # update-rc.d cellml.instance defaults

You could test by doing
    
    # /etc/init.d/cellml.zeoserver start
    # /etc/init.d/cellml.instance start

Then connect to your site.  For intended result, restart your server
and ensure that both services come back online.

Of course, if you renamed other paths/files please update your copy of
the scripts accordingly.
