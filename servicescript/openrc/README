These OpenRC init scripts may be copied into ``/etc/init.d``.

Define INSTANCE_HOME, DAEMONUSER, DAEMONGROUP in each of the scripts,
and do the following to add them to default startup:

    # rc-update add cellml.zeoserver default
    # rc-update add cellml.instance default

Test that the script works by manually start the services:

    # /etc/init.d/cellml.zeoserver start
    # /etc/init.d/cellml.instance start

Then connect to the site.  To ensure a fully working installation, do a
full restart and ensure that both these services are online after.

Naturally, if any paths/files have been renamed, the modified values
should be applied to the scripts accordingly.
